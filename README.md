status](https://github.com/UrbanAnalyst/uamutations/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)](https://github.com/UrbanAnalyst/uamutations/actions?query=workflow%3ARust)

Code for the [Urban Analyst](https://urbananalyst.city) algorithm that mutates
cities to become more like other cities. This repo enables the code to be run,
tested, and developed in isolation, rather than as part of the main website.
